### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

To run the tests associated with this project, run `make test`.

For code coverage, run `make coverage`.

###Coding Guidelines

Please conform to [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) standards for all developm
ent.

The `pep8` and `autopep8` modules are a part of the `dev-requirements`, and has been added to the `Makefile`.  Please edit for your project, and change `sample` to the module for your project.  Once this is completed, you can run `make pep8` for statistics, or `make pep8-verbose` for a detailed breakout of violations.

If you wish to automatically manage adherance to the PEP8 standard, use the module `autopep8`.  You can learn more about it [here](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/autopep8).  An `autopep8` action has been included in the `Makefile` for a sane default use as needed.

While these skeletons are meant to be a sane default, projects will occasionally deviate due to
 special requirements or circumstances.  As such, while the skeletons take care to conform to s
tandards, please use caution when deviating from these implementations.
